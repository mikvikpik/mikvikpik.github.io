### My Future
I'm looking for work that matters. It has to matter to someone. It has to affect people. I know that it usually affects someone's bottom line, but what else does it affect? Does it create happiness for someone else? Does it determine if someone lives or dies, passes or fails, or is it something that changes those paradigms? How can I be part of that picture? That is the work that matters to me.

### My Present
Lambda school has been an amazing and rewarding experience. I've overcome the obstacles of limiting beliefs and legacy education bias. I've further rooted myself in believing that work stemming from happiness is the greatest single attribute to have and creates my ambition going forward.

### My History

I've always been a leader. My diverse history includes many jobs that had me rise higher because I worked harder, was aware of more, and acted with common sense. Most importantly, I am motivated by the team and how to best operate with them. It is my greatest asset and can be my fatal flaw. I've been known to take the weight of the team on my shoulders. While that seems heroic, it is hardly the attribute of a true leader. I've come to understand that leadership is teaching others how to shoulder their own weight and help the team to create something bigger than themselves.
The variable that has caused this has always been my work ethic. I look to find things that I can and will improve. This improvement leads to the mental understanding that improvement can be incremental and still be deemed improvement. Even if the metric that is focused on is seeming to decline, there are others that will be improving as long as you look for the things to improve.
I've worked to get here. I've worked to show these skills. I've worked to be successful. I'm ready to work.
