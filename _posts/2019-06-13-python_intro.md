Like Indiana Jones said while on his many adventures, why did it have to be snakes? Before being here, I had heard about Hyper Text Markup Language, Cascading Style Sheets, and some sets of letters with some symbols after them that could be musical or mathematical in notation. I liked to think that I knew about computers since I was a kid because I could troubleshoot any problem my mom had when we had an old Gateway computer that looked like a cow somehow leased it's prints to be on hardware. Little did I know that there is a huge difference between a user interface and programming code.

After spending some time doing some graphic design and working up to web design did I realize that there is a completely different world outside of the matrix. I didn't have the courage or experience like Neo and I took the blue pill to keep myself hidden from the overwhelming world that is programming.
