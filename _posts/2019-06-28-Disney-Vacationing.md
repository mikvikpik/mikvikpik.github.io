### What is the Perfect Vacation?
That all depends on how you vacation. Do you relax? Do you explore? Do you go to festivals? Do you go overseas? If the answer is yes to all of these, then you should check out Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida!

It's not all just for kids. And it's for more than just riding rollercoasters and saying hi to Mickey Mouse. There's a whole new world to explore and more magic than you can fathom. Thanks to [TouringPlans.com](https://touringplans.com/magic-kingdom/touring-plans/adults), they've got great itineraries for just that. They've also got some great data that they're using to support [Data Science and Machine Learning](https://touringplans.com/blog/2018/06/25/disney-world-wait-times-available-for-data-science-and-machine-learning/) folks like us.

This data has nearly 200 different metrics to delve into and for any Disney fan who would like their hand to try and forecast their own best visit with the shortest weight times, I encourage you to check it out.

So, *what is the perfect time for vacation* if you're going to Walt Disney World Resort? And you're in your mid-twenties to young-at-heart age? When would that be? That answer most times is when it's least crowded. *A better answer would be when there's less kids.* 

Let's start here.

Looking at the months in general we can see that the **lowest percentages of kids in school are** on average<span style="color:red"> March, June, July, August, and December</span>. So could we really go any time that's not those months? Hypotheically, yes. But let's look at more detail.

This graph shows daily which schools are in session. Step number one to a kid-free Disney vacation is to look for the <span style="color:green">*green spaces*</span> based on kids being in school. This is when there's gonna be less people at Disney, not to mention less tantrums, less messes, less kids. The second would be to see <span style="color:green">timing</span> what fits best for you. 

It's important to note that the data gets better after 2014 when weekends are not as highly factored by looking at the piano key segments. <span style="color:green"><i>The most optimal times seem to be when there are holidays or breaks either about to come up or having just passed.</i></span>

There's great chucks of time for a vacation that many think to overlook because of any various reasons. Just after New Years in January or after summer ends in September are notable not only because school is back in session, but because maybe money is already spent. And apparently the month of May would be great to take your mother to treat her to the magic she's always deserved.

While it seems fairly obvious, <span style="color:red">take into account that with every kid comes at least a parent and a best friend </span>to share the experience of the magical place on earth. So there's even more intangibles that aren't seen in the data and has to be inferred. And while you won't avoid all the kids heading to Walt Disney World, the satisfaction of not having to be aware of the rogue 5 year old is a blessing for me for now.
