What makes data science interesting for people, or for anybody, or for me? 

Taking the personal view is it really doesn't. I'm not interested in statistics or programming. There's no magic voodoo in those things. It's not going to give me magical powers and I don't expect it. It's something that takes determination to learn. Something that would be insane if I went to college knowing that I would lose interest in the even duller subjects that are taught in monotone. But could I take 9 months out of my life to be interested in something? Yeah.

I'm really interested in video games and how they have changed the landscape of entertainment since I was a kid. The idea that turning a passive screen into an interactive experience that can actively get my heart racing every time there's a twist or turn fascinates my inner child. I'm interested in sports and bellowing a gutteral clamor when the game starts getting out of hand and the time is dwindling. I'm even interested in the metrics of business and how millions of business owners and entrpreneurs create and contribute to a vast, tangible global economy from an immaterial thought. I'm interested in the theories and ideas that can make the world and better place, and what a better place means to people.

There's so many ways to involve my interests into a practice that would be deemed practical or straightforward. Yet, the societal and technological landscapes are changing and so is the rumor mill of how jobs will slowly be fading from existence because of automation. Even that is a piece of information that holds interest. Data science is really the abstract value of what I want to make it out to be. Game science can be as simple as wondering how do gamers react to certain mechanics in a storyline that makes the game a thousand times more interesting or breaks and beats it into a giant flop. Sport science can become the theory and changing force of making a team that wins versus making a team that is entertaining much like the baseball moneyball theory. How can business science be taken a step further to quantify return on investment that breaks down the overvaluation of tech companies that make money out of thin air and are funded by an ever flowing waterfall of investment rounds? Could there be change on the cusp of these new fields of work and study?

So, maybe I'm wrong. I would be willing to contend that view. Data science is interesting, but not for the tools that need to be used like some disposable utensils. The tools need to utilized, understood, respected, and revered like fine steel knives that are used to cut the most delicious steaks, or the ever popular pizza. Data science can be used in many realms that we have yet to see, but are making waves into all fields. The highest point of interest is where will we find data science make it's biggest impact on the future of our way of life.
